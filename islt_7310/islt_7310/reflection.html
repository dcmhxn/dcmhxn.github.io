        <h2>Degree and Career Program - Environmental Sciences - Land and Soil</h2>

        <p>Since my first semester of my sophmore year of college, I have been pursuing a degree in environmental sciences emphasizing in land and soil. The reason I chose this degree was due to my interest in the environment and the systems within it. Since being involved in this degree program, my approach toward my school work has changed incredibly. I find myself enjoying the school work and hands-on activities such as labs which is leading to me understanding this material as well.</p>
        <p>Ideally, I aspire for my proffesion to be in the field of row crop insurance or an agriculture-related company specializing in buying and selling agricultural product and supplies. This being my plan for the future, I plan to use my degree in environmental sciences to give myself a competitive advantage from my plant and soil-based background including my farm setting experience from previous jobs. I have and will continue to take classes that grow my knowledge and background essential for an employee in this line of work.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2><!--Heading 2/2-->

        <ul>
            <li>Obtain a position as an environmental scientist in agriculture crop insurance</li>
            <li>Obtain a position as an environmental scientist in buying and selling agricultural products and supplies</li>
            <li>Own my own farm</li>
        </ul>

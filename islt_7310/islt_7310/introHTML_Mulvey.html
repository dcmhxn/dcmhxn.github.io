Hi everyone! My name is Drew Mulvey and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Missouri-Columbia studying Environmental Sciences with an emphasis in land and soil. As some might come to realize, I’m not what one would call knowledgeable when it comes to technology and especially web designing. This being said, I have zero previous experience with web application or development, but I am very eager to learn about the ins and outs of web development to enhance my resume and to understand how coding works. With the web development skills I acquire after this course is over, I hope to be able create my own personal web page to put on my resume that entails information about me and past experience in different fields of work. When I’m not buried to my neck in homework, I like to play golf and spend time with my dog, Sammy. Can’t wait to get to know everyone through our very own web pages!
